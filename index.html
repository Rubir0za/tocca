                <p>Tocca Amalfi is more than a travel experience ‚Äî it's a feeling. One you carry in your skin, your memory, your soul.</p>
                <p>Born from my lifelong love for travel, shaped by years living across 7 countries and 5 continents ‚Äî including two decades in the U.S. working as an executive and director in the travel industry ‚Äî Tocca Amalfi is the most personal chapter of my journey.</p>
                <p>It was here ‚Äî on the Amalfi Coast ‚Äî that I found what I never expected: love, family, home, and a sense of belonging. Now a local by heart and by choice, I invite you to experience this coast not as a tourist, but as part of its rhythm.</p>
                <p><strong>My mission is simple:</strong><br>
                To offer something exceptional, personal, and lasting ‚Äî an experience that stays in your heart long after your suitcase is unpacked.</p>
